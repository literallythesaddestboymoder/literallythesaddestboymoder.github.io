So you have a few options at your disposal and I will be going through them one by one, ranked in my ~~subjective~~ objective opinions, from worst to best. And what do I base this opinions on? A combination of efficacy, ease of administration, ease of procurement, long term safety, convenience, cost and ease of concealment (might be important for those of you still living with parents or if you’re stuck in some draconian hostel). Also with pills, they are usually not very effective just on their own and you will need to pair an androgen blocker with it. So, I will be covering a subsection for androgen blockers too.

# Forewarning
This guide is by no means an exhaustive tutorial and the onus is on you to do your own research before you start DIYing hormones. While I believe the risks associated with DIYing hormones is overblown on reddit, there are always exceptions and you might run into problems that I or other DIYers never faced. It is upto you to weigh the risks vs the rewards for yourself. And once again, please take a look at all the resources I have pasted here. 

## Estrogen 
# Pills

> **Procurement** - <span style="color:green">5/5</span> \
> **Long Term Safety** - <span style="color:red">1/5</span> (synthetic oral E), <span style="color:orange">3/5</span> (bioidentical oral E), <span style="color:green">4/5</span> (bioidentical sublingual E) \

Your major options here with bioidentical E in India are going to be Progynova and Estrabet. Estrabet is a hemihydrate form of estradiol and can be taken sublingually, progynova however cannot be adminstered sublingually. For synthetic oral E, there is diane 35 which is a mixture of ethinyl estradiol and cyproterone (an anti-androgen) - DO NOT USE THIS UNLESS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE. Diane 35 is effective but very hard on your liver and will cause issues in the long term. YOU CANNOT DRINK ALCOHOL IF YOU ARE ON DIANE 35 - RISK OF LIVER FAILURE. Only use this for maybe a month or two at best and please switch to bioidentical E after that. 

# Injections 

> **Efficacy** - <span style="color:green">5/5</span> \
> **Administration** - <span style="color:orange">2/5</span> (IM injections), <span style="color:green">4/5</span> (subQ injections)\
> **Procurement** - <span style="color:orange">2/5</span> \
> **Long Term Safety** - <span style="color:red">5/5</span> \
> **Convenience** - <span style="color:green">4/5</span> (EV), <span style="color:green">5/5</span> (EEn)\
> **Concealment** - <span style="color:red">1/5</span> 

EV, EEn, ECy, There are a ton of esters that can give you a range of good levels depending on your prefered dose scheduling. The levels are the most stable of the bunch, there are local suppliers for EV and EEn. Injections can be bought OTC ( or ordered off swiggy instamart if you want to avoid any human contact). There are two methods of injecting, SubQ is honestly barely an inconvenience and you could pick it up quite easily. 

EV- Estradiol valerate is the easiest available option, there are local manufactureres that do deliver the biggest hurdle would be concealement and learning to self inject. While the initial effort is a bit intimidating, it does give you the 

## Andogen Blockers 
There’s a wide range of androgen blockers and they mainly come in three types - pills, injections, and implants 

# Pills 
your options here are spironolactone, cyproterone, bicalutamide, and dutasteride and finasteride (not really, but they block DHT rather than testosterone). Spironolactone is probably the easiest to source, but it is not very effective and causes a lot of really annoying side effects - low blood pressure, salt cravings, frequent urination because its a diuretic, high potassium (so you should probably avoid high potassium foods when you are it). Still, its the safest of the bunch and you should be good sticking with spiro, provided 

# injections 
You can get monthly or quarter - yearly shots of GnRH antagonists. Barring implants, this is almost as good as it gets when it comes to T suppression. It will completely shut down T production but they do not come cheap. Monthly shots of Lupron is around 3000 rupees INR approximately. 

# implants 
Fanciest tech on here but I am not even sure if you can get supprelin implants in India. 

# Gels 

Efficacy - 3/5
Administration - 3/5 
Procurement - 3/5
Long Term Safety - 5/5
Convenience - 3/5
Concealment - 4/5

Dosing is really difficult with gels for some people and might lead to inconsisent levels.
